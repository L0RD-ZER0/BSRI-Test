Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI) Test
==================================

The [Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI)][BSRI] is a measure of masculinity and femininity,
and is used to research gender roles. It assesses how people identify themselves
psychologically. Sandra Bem's goal of the BSRI was to examine psychological androgyny
and provide empirical evidence to show the advantage of a shared masculine and feminine
personality versus a sex-typed categorization. The test is formatted with 60 different
personality traits which participants rate themselves based on a 7-point Likert scale.
Traits are evenly dispersed, 20 masculine, 20 feminine, and 20 filler traits thought to
be gender neutral. All traits in the BSRI are positively valued personality aspects.
Numerous past studies have found that gender categorizations are correlated with many
stereotypical gendered behaviors.


This application aims to conduct a BSRI Test and provide the results to the user.
